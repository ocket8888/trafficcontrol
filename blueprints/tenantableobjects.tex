\section{Tenantable Objects\label{sec:tenantable}}
A "tenantable" object is one that MUST obey Tenancy rules, as described in Section \ref{sec:tenancy}. For APIv3.0, the following
object types are to be considered tenantable:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Delivery Services
	\item Origins
	\item Tenants
	\item Users
\end{itemize}

This list may not be exhaustive of the tenantable types that will be introduced throughout the lifetime of API v3, and plugins
may at any time add tenantable objects to Traffic Ops.
