\section{Data Model\label{sec:data-model}}
This section defines the various objects that may be interacted with through the
Traffic Ops API and their respective properties.\\
An object's properties may principally be of several different types:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Integers. Integers may be signed or unsigned, to signify whether or
	not they are capable of being less than zero. Representation formats which
	are incapable of distinguishing integral and floating-point numbers (e.g.
	JSON) or of separately describing signed and unsigned types (e.g. JSON
	again) MUST represent these as numbers. In particular, they MUST NOT be
	represented as string types. Furthermore, they MUST NOT be represented with
	a non-zero decimal component and generally SHOULD NOT be represented with a
	decimal part at all, if possible. Unsigned quantities MUST NOT include a
	sign (even \code{+}, were it supported by the format).

	\item Floating-point numbers. Floating point numbers are guaranteed to have
	a precision of at least 64-bits, but clients SHOULD NOT treat
	representations with a greater apparent precision as if they were more
	precise than 64 bits can offer. Endpoints MUST NOT implement Not-a-Number
	nor either positive or negative Infinity values as floating-point numbers,
	even if the representation format supports them.

	\item Strings. Strings SHOULD always be encoded (along with the rest of the
	representation, if possible) in UTF-8.

	\item Dates/times. As discussed in section \ref{sec:datetime}, these may be
	expressed as either strings in RFC3339 format or as a signed integer number
	of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch if the representation format does not
	support date/time types natively (e.g. JSON).

	\item Booleans. Boolean concepts MUST be represented as boolean data types
	in representations that do support them. For example, in JSON,
	\code{\{"foo":true\}} is acceptable but \code{\{"foo":"true"\}},
	\code{\{"foo":1\}} and especially \code{\{"foo":"1"\}} are all unacceptable.
	In representation formats that do not support boolean types, they may be
	represented as the number zero for "false" and the number one for "true" as
	unsigned integers.

	\item Collections. There are several collection types used to model ATC
	data. Commonly, they all may contain arbitrary data types, but SHOULD NOT
	contain data of more than one type in any representation format.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sets. A set is an unordered collection of unique items. The
		contents of a set are not guaranteed to be in any particular order, and
		clients SHOULD NOT expect anything else\footnote{Endpoint authors are,
		however, encouraged to order these consistently for ease of use,
		testing, and debugging. This order need not - and indeed SHOULD NOT be
		documented.} (unless the endpoint provides sorting functionality
		expressly), and in particular SHOULD NOT conclude that a difference in
		ordering indicates that data has changed. If a representation format is
		not capable of expressing set types (e.g. JSON), then sets may be
		expressed as a list array or other more generic collection, but MUST
		NEVER contain duplicates.

		\item Lists/Arrays. A list/array is an \emph{ordered} collection of
		data, and as such the ordering MUST be consistent in representations, as
		well as meaningful.

		\item Maps. A map may be used to associate any non-collection type "key"
		with a "value" of arbitrary type. Maps MUST NOT contain duplicate keys
		in any representation format. If a representation format is not capable
		of representing maps (e.g. JSON), then they may be represented as
		objects where the keys are coerced to property names and their values
		the respective values of those properties.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

With the "fallback" behavior described for each type above, note that valid
representation formats MUST be capable of representing at least floating-point
values, string values, array/lists of such primitive values, and either nested
object structures or maps.
