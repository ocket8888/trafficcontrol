\subsection{Delivery Services}
Delivery Services are, at their most basic, an association between a source of
content and a set of Cache Servers and configuration options used to distribute
that content.

\subsubsection{Active}
A Delivery Service that is "active" is one that is functionally in service, and
capable of delivering content. This is a boolean concept and is represented by
boolean values. A Delivery Service cannot be Active if it is not Primed.

\subsubsection{Primed}
A Delivery Service that is "primed" has had its configuration distributed to the
various servers required to serve its content. However, the content itself is
still inaccessible\footnote{The content is not available through normal routing.
This does not, though, guarantee that Cache Servers do not already have the
content stored and/or are incapable of serving it if routing is bypassed.}. A
Delivery Service that is Active is necessarily Primed.
