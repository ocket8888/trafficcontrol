\title{%
Traffic Ops API\\
\large Guidelines and v4.0 Blueprint\\
\normalsize Draft Version \version{}}
\author{The Traffic Ops Working Group}
\maketitle{}

\abstract{This document is intended to serve as a blueprint to be followed when
implementing the 4.0 version of the Traffic Ops API, as well as a set of
guidelines to be followed when implementing the API routes herein defined and
any subsequently added API endpoints. Plugin developers may also find the
guidelines useful, though obviously any code not directly contributed to the
project is outside of this document's purview.\\
For Traffic Ops API version 4.0, several changes to the API model were discussed
including, but not limited to, switching from a REST structure to GraphQL,
breaking the API apart into multiple separate microservices or even separate
APIs, and doing away with cookie-based authentication. These ideas have not been
adopted and the discussions regarding them tabled for a later date in favor of
making the already sweeping changes herein outlined no more disruptive than they
absolutely need to be and easing the transition of clients.}
