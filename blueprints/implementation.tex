\section{Implementation Details}
This section outlines requirements and guidelines specific to the
implementation of tops discussed in any of the preceeding sections.

\subsection{ETags\label{sec:etags}}
Most Data Model objects will at some point generate Entity Tags (ETags) that
allow clients to identify unique representations of the same object. To ensure
ETags are generated which are guaranteed to be useful, all Entity Tags for
Data Model objects (as described in Section \ref{sec:data-model}) MUST follow
the format in Listing \ref{code:etag-format}, wherein Unicode code point 0xWXYZ
is encoded as \code{\%xWXYZ} (with leading zeros skipped).

\begin{codelisting}
\captionof{listing}{Unsorted Foos Response}
\label{code:etag-format}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=2]{abnf}
ETAG = TIMESTAMP ":" OBJECT_TYPE [":" IDENTIFIER]
TIMESTAMP = DIGIT *(DIGIT)
DIGIT = %x30-39
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
ALPHANUM = DIGIT / ALPHA / "_"
OBJECT_TYPE = ALPHANUM *(ALPHANUM)
CHAR = ALPHANUM / %x20-2F / %x3B-40 / %x5B-60 / %7B-7E / %A0-2A9
\end{minted}
\end{codelisting}

In this format, TIMESTAMP is the number of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch at
which the object was last modified. OBJECT\_TYPE is the name of the type of
Data Model object the requested resource is, case-folded to UPPERCASE and using
underscores instead of spaces e.g. "Delivery Service" becomes
"DELIVERY_SERVICE". IDENTIFIER is the object's identifier, when applicable.\\
For collections, ETags should be generated using the TIMESTAMP value calculated
for the most recently updated object in the collection, and the optional part
of the ETag containing the IDENTIFIER should be left out.
