\subsection{Tags}
Tags may be used to group "taggable" objects for logical or administrative
purposes.\\
While plug-ins and other third-party code such as custom configuration
management systems may glean some semantic meaning from a Tag's Name or
presence on an object, Traffic Control components - \emph{including Traffic Ops
and its API} - MUST NOT infer any special meaning from any Tag's Name or
presence on an object, nor attach any semantic value to a Tag's presence on an
object, a Tag's Name, or any pattern of Tag Name.\\
What is known as a "taggable" object is simply any object with a "Tags"
property that contains a set of Tag Names which are the tags associated with
said object. Thus, any object types added to the API at any point in the future
may be "taggable", but for the data model herein outlined the following objects
those that are "taggable":

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cache Groups
	\item Cache Servers
	\item Delivery Services
	\item Infrastructure Servers
	\item Origins
	\item Physical Locations
	\item Profiles
	\item Tenants
	\item Topologies
	\item Users
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Name}
Name is the only property of a Tag, and is therefore a unique identifier for
a Tag. It is a string that ought to give some indication of what the Tag is for
but ultimately any meaning for the Tag is left to system administrators to
define and maintain.\\
This string MUST NOT be empty and MUST only contain alphanumeric characters,
"=", and "_".
