\subsection{Origins}
Origins are sources of content for the CDN to serve. They are typically external
to the CDN's infrastructure and in many cases may in fact not be administered by
the same organization as the CDN.

%TODO: necessary?
% \subsubsection{ID}
% An Origin's ID is an unsigned integer that identifies it uniquely. It serves no
% other purpose than to uniquely identify an Origin.

\subsubsection{IPv4 Address}
This string is a valid IP (v4) address at which the Origin may be found, or
"null"-typed to indicate there is no static IPv4 Address where the Origin may be
relied on to be.

\subsubsection{IPv6 Address}
This string is a valid IP (v6) address at which the Origin may be found, or
"null"-typed to indicate there is no static IPv6 Address where the Origin may be
relied on to be.

\subsubsection{Notes}
This is a free text field used to record miscellaneous notes about the Origin.

\subsubsection{Physical Location}
The Physical Location at which an Origin resides is represented by a string that
is its Name.

\subsubsection{Tags}
The Tags associated with an Origin - or, with which it is "tagged" - are a set
of strings that are Tag Names.

\subsubsection{Tenant}
The Tenant to which an Origin belongs is represented by a string which is its
Name.

\subsubsection{URL}
An Origin's URL is a string that is a valid URL which is used by the CDN (and
ostensibly any client) to request content. As such, the only supported protocol
schemes are those for HTTP and HTTPS - though this is not enforced as a
restriction on the values of the URL.\\
The port part of the network location within the URL may be included, but will
be inferred from the scheme if it is not, e.g. 80 for HTTP protocol schemes.\\
An Origin's URL is also used to uniquely identify it. URLs are considered unique
if they are unique \emph{in totality} - but \emph{not} including inferred
quantities. That is, \code{https://github.com} is uniquely distinguishable from
\code{http://github.com}, but \emph{not} from \code{https://github.com:443}.\\
URLs MUST NOT have paths - other than optionally specifying the root path
(\code{/}) - as content is always assumed to be retrieved relative to the root
of the Origin service.
