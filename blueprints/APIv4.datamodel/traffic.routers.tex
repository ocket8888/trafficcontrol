\subsection{Traffic Routers}
Traffic Routers are Traffic Router instances. They contain all of the server
information as well as configuration for the Traffic Router service.

\subsubsection{Cache Control Max Age}
This unsigned integer is the value - in seconds - used for the "max-age"
parameter of the Cache-Control HTTP header in HTTP responses to the client. If
it is "null"-typed then Traffic Router will use its default setting - which is
defined by Traffic Router and not by the Traffic Ops API.

\subsubsection{CDN}
The CDN to which a Traffic Router belongs is represented by its Name, which
uniquely identifies it. The Traffic Router MUST be an/the authoritative DNS
server for the Domain of the CDN to which it belongs.

\subsubsection{Coverage Zone Polling Interval}
This unsigned integer is the interval - in milliseconds - on which Traffic
Router will poll for an updated Coverage Zone File. A "null"-typed value causes
Traffic Router to use its default interval duration, which is not defined by the
Traffic Ops API.

\subsubsection{Deep Coverage Zone Polling Interval}
This unsigned integer is the interval - in milliseconds - on which Traffic
Router will poll for an updated Deep Coverage Zone File. A "null"-typed value
causes Traffic Router to use its default interval duration, which is not defined
by the Traffic Ops API.

\subsubsection{DNSSEC}
This property is an object, the properties of which are configuration options
for DNSSEC-related behavior.

\paragraph{Allow Expired Keys}
A boolean which, when true, will allow Traffic Router to use expired DNSSEC keys
to sign zones.

\paragraph{Effective Multiplier}
An integer that is used when creating an effective date for a new DNSSEC key
set. New keys are generated with an effective date that is the effective
multiplier multiplied by the Time to Live less than the old key's expiration
date. A "null"-typed value instructs Traffic Router to use its pre-configured
default value, which is not defined by the Traffic Ops API\footnote{At the time
of this writing, the default value is 2.}.

\paragraph{Fetch Interval}
An unsigned integer that defines the interval - in seconds - on which Traffic
Router will check the Traffic Ops API for new DNSSEC keys. A "null"-typed value
instructs Traffic Router to use its pre-configured default value - which is not
defined by the Traffic Ops API.

\paragraph{Fetch Retries}
An unsigned integer that defines the number of times Traffic Router will attempt
to load DNSSEC keys before giving up. A "null"-typed value instructs Traffic
Router to use its pre-configured default number of retries - which is not
defined by the Traffic Ops API\footnote{The default value at the time of this
writing is 5.}.

\paragraph{Fetch Timeout}
An unsigned integer that defines the timeout - in milliseconds - for requests to
the DNSSEC key management endpoint(s) of the Traffic Ops API. A "null"-typed
value indicates that Traffic Router should not time-out such requests.

\paragraph{Fetch Wait}
An unsigned integer that defines the number of milliseconds Traffic Router will
wait between attempts to load DNSSEC keys ("retries"). A "null"-typed value
instructs Traffic Router to use its pre-configured default value - which is not
defined by the Traffic Ops API.

\paragraph{Generation Multiplier}
An unsigned integer used to determine when new DNSSEC keys need to be generated.
Keys are re-generated if expiration is less than the Generation Multiplier
multiplied by the Time to Live. A "null"-typed value instructs Traffic Router to
use its pre-configured default multiplier - which is not defined by the Traffic
Ops API\footnote{The default value at the time of this writing is 10.}.

\paragraph{Zone Comparisons}
A boolean which, when true - and DNSSEC is enabled on the CDN to which this
Traffic Router belongs - allows Traffic Router to compare existing zones with
newly generated zones. If the newly generated zone is the same as the existing
zone, Traffic Router will simply re-use the existing signed zone instead of
signing the same, new zone.

\subsubsection{Domain}
This is the "domain" part of the Cache Server's Fully Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN) as a string. For example, a Cache Server with an FQDN of
\code{github.com} has a Domain of \code{com} and a Cache Server with an FQDN of
\code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Domain of \code{apache.org}.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Zone Cache Priming}
This property is an object whose properties are configuration options for
"Dynamic Zone Cache Priming".

\paragraph{Prime}
A boolean which, if true, will allow Traffic Router to prime the dynamic zone
cache.

\paragraph{Priming Limit}
An unsigned integer used to limit the number of permutations to prime when
"Dynamic Zone Cache Priming". A "null"-typed value instructs Traffic Router to
use its pre-configured default, which is not defined by the Traffic Ops
API\footnote{The default value is 500 at the time of this writing.}.

\subsubsection{EDNS0 Client Subnet Enabled}
A boolean that sets whether or not the EDNS0 DNS extension mechanism described
in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2671}{RFC2671} should be made available
to clients.

\subsubsection{Forced Diversity}
A boolean which, when true, causes Traffic Router to diversify the list of Cache
Servers returned in responses to requests for STEERING-type Delivery Services'
content by including more unique Edge-Tier Cache Servers in the response to the
client's request.

\subsubsection{Geolocation Polling Interval}
An unsigned integer number of milliseconds that Traffic Router will use as an
interval on which to poll for an geographic IP mapping database. A "null"-typed
value will instruct Traffic Router to use its pre-configured default value -
which is not defined by the Traffic Ops API.

\subsubsection{Host Name}
This is the "host" part of the Cache Server's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
as a string. For example, a Cache Server with an FQDN of \code{github.com} has a
Host Name of \code{github}, and a Cache Server with an FQDN of
\code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Host Name of \code{trafficcontrol}.\\
This field does NOT need to be unique, though operators are encouraged to make
this - or at least the concatenation \code{\emph{Host Name}.{Domain}} - unique
for ease of operation.

\subsubsection{ID}
A Cache Server's "ID" is an unsigned integer that uniquely identifies it among
all Cache Servers. It serves no purpose beyond unique identification of the
Cache Server.

\subsubsection{Notes}
This section is an arbitrary string containing miscellaneous, human-friendly
information about the Cache Server. Other ATC components SHOULD NOT parse this
for specific information fields, or expect it to be in a particular format.

\subsubsection{Physical Location}
The Physical Location at which a Cache Server resides is represented by a string
containing its Name.

\subsubsection{SOA}
This property is an object that contains configuration information for the
"Start of Authority" (SOA) records served by the Traffic Router.

\paragraph{Admin}
An email address for the administrator of the DNS zones for which Traffic Router
is authoritative. This string may be "null"-typed to indicate such an address is
unavailable.

\paragraph{Expire}
An unsigned integer number of seconds which will be used in the "expire" field
the Traffic Router DNS Server will respond with on SOA records.

\paragraph{Minimum}
An unsigned integer number of seconds which will be used as the value for the
"minimum" field the Traffic Router DNS Server will respond with on SOA records.

\paragraph{Refresh}
An unsigned integer number of seconds which will be used as the value for the
"refresh" field the Traffic Router DNS Server will respond with on SOA records.

\paragraph{Retry}
An unsigned integer number of seconds which will be used as the value for the
"retry" field the Traffic Router DNS Server will respond with on SOA records.

\subsubsection{Steering Polling Interval}
An unsigned integer number of seconds on which Traffic Router will check for new
steering mappings. A "null"-typed value instructs Traffic Router to use its
pre-configured default interval - which is not defined by the Traffic Ops API.

\subsubsection{TTLs}
This property is a map of record types (in lower-case) to unsigned integers that
are the Time-to-Live values that Traffic Router will use for the named DNS
record type.\\
The meaningful keys in this map are (but are not limited to for the forseeable
future):

\begin{itemize}
	\item a
	\item aaaa
	\item dnskey
	\item ds
	\item ns
	\item soa
\end{itemize}
