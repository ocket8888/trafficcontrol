\subsection{Topologies}
A Topology is a interconnected tree of Cache Groups that defines the flow of
content for a Delivery Service.

\subsubsection{Description}
A Topology's Description is a short string (no actual length limit) that
describes the Topology.

\subsubsection{Name}
This string uniquely identifies a Topology. It MUST only contain alphanumeric
characters and hyphens/dashes (-).

\subsubsection{Nodes}
A Topology's Nodes are an array of the Cache Groups and their relationships.
Each Node is itself an object.

\paragraph{Cache Group}
The Cache Group to which a Node refers is identified by this string, which is
its Name.

\paragraph{Parents}
The Parents of this Node are identified as an array of unsigned integers which
are the indexes in the Topology's Nodes array at which they occur. The maximum
number of parents is two, where the first element in the Parents array is
commonly referred to as the "primary parent" and the second one is referred to
as the "secondary parent".
