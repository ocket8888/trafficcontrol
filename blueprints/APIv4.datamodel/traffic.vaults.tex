\subsection{Traffic Vaults}
A Traffic Vault is a service for storing "secrets" - which is a general term
mainly used to encompass encryption private keys. URL signing keys, URI
signature keys, SSL keys, and DNSSEC keys are all stored within Traffic Vaults.

% \subsubsection{Domain\label{sec:server:domain}}
% This is the "domain" part of the Traffic Vault's Fully Qualified Domain Name
% (FQDN) as a string. For example, a Traffic Vault with an FQDN of
% \code{github.com} has a Domain of \code{com} and a Traffic Vault with an FQDN of
% \code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Domain of \code{apache.org}.\\
% In other words, this is every part of the Traffic Vault's Fully Qualified Domain
% Name that isn't part of its Host Name as defined in Section
% \ref{sec:server:hostname}.

% \subsubsection{Host Name\label{sec:server:hostname}}
% This is the "host" part of the Traffic Vault's Fully Qualified Domain Name
% (FQDN) as a string. For example, a Traffic Vault with an FQDN of
% \code{github.com} has a Host Name of \code{github}, and a Traffic Vault with an
% FQDN of \code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Host Name of
% \code{trafficcontrol}.\\
% In other words, a Traffic Vault's Host Name is the only part of its FQDN that
% is not part of its Domain as defined in Section \ref{sec:server:domain}.\\
% This field does NOT need to be unique, though operators are encouraged to make
% this - or at least the concatenation \code{\emph{Host Name}.\emph{Domain}}
% - unique for ease of operation.

\subsubsection{FQDN}
A Traffic Vault's FQDN is a string that is a valid DNS name that uniquely
identifies it among Traffic Vaults. It is also the DNS name at which its service
may be requested.
