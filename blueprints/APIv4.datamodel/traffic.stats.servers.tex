\subsection{Traffic Stats Servers}
Traffic Stats Servers are instances of Traffic Stats and contain information
relating to their network connection information as well as configuration.

\subsubsection{Domain}
The "domain" part of the Traffic Stats Server's Fully Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN) as a string. For example, a Traffic Stats Server with an FQDN of
\code{github.com} has a Domain of \code{com} and a Traffic Stats Server with an
FQDN of \code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Domain of \code{apache.org}.\\
In other words, this is every part of the Traffic Stats Server's FQDN that
isn't part of its Host Name.

\subsubsection{Host Name}
This is the "host" part of the Traffic Stats Server's Fully Qualified Domain
Name (FQDN) as a string. For example, a Traffic Stats Server with an FQDN of
\code{github.com} has a Host Name of \code{github}, and a Traffic Stats Server
with an FQDN of \code{trafficcontrol.apache.org} has a Host Name of
\code{trafficcontrol}.\\
In other words, a Traffic Stats Server's Host Name is the only part of its FQDN
that is not part of its Domain.\\
This field does NOT need to be unique, though operators are encouraged to make
this - or at least the concatenation \code{\emph{Host Name}.\emph{Domain}} -
unique for ease of operation.

\subsubsection{ID}
An integral, unique identifier for the Traffic Stats Server. It carries no
meaning or significance beyond being a unique identifier.

\subsubsection{Notes}
This is a string of arbitrary text for miscellaneous purposes.

\subsubsection{Physical Location}
This string gives the Name of a Physical Location within which this Traffic
Stats Server resides. If this is "null"-typed value, then it is understood that
the Traffic Stats Server has no well-defined and/or meaningful Physical
Location.
