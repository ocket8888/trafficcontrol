\subsection{Invalidation Jobs}
Invalidation Jobs - also called "content invalidation jobs", "revalidations",
"content revalidation jobs", "revalidation jobs", or even just "jobs" - are, at
their most basic, periods of time during which specific content should not be
served from cache but instead considered cache-invalid and fetched from
upstream. These objects are limited in scope to within a particular Delivery
Service, but are not strictly "Tenantable", as such.

/**
 * InvalidationJob objects represent - broadly speaking - periods of time during
 * which specific content will be fetch from upstream instead of served from
 * cache.
 */
interface InvalidationJob {
	assetPattern: RegExp;
	createdBy: string;
	deliveryService: string;
	id: bigint;
	startTime: Date;
	timeToLive: bigint;
}
\end{minted}
\end{codelisting}

\subsubsection{Asset Pattern}
This is a regular expression that defines the content paths which will be
"invalidated". It MUST begin with \code{/} since all valid request paths begin
with \code{/}. Example: \code{/.*\textbackslash{}.jpg}.

\subsubsection{Created By}
The User that created the Invalidation Job may be referenced by this string
which is their Username\footnote{This Username will be visible to Users with the
appropriate Permission(s) to see Invalidation Jobs, regardless of Tenancy;
Invalidation Jobs are not "Tenantantable".}.

\subsubsection{Delivery Service}
The Delivery Service within which the Invalidation Job operates is given by this
string which is its Name\footnote{This Name will be visible to Users with the
appropriate Permissions(s) to see Invalidation Jobs, regardless of Tenancy;
Invalidation Jobs are not "Tenantable". However, new Invalidation Jobs can only
be created for Delivery Services within the requesting User's Tenancy.}.

\subsubsection{ID}
ID is an unsigned integer that uniquely identifies an Invalidation Job. There is
no semantic meaning to this property other than unique identification.

\subsubsection{Start Time}
This is the date and time at which the Invalidation Job is set to begin. Upon
creation, this MUST be in the future.

\subsubsection{Time to Live}
This unsigned integer number of hours for which the Invalidation Job should
remain "active" - that is, this defines the window within which the specified
content will not be served from cache.\\
This may not be zero ($0$). This has an upper bound at creation time defined by
the Max Revalidation Days property of the Global Configuration object.
